# Projekt_EDV-TEK
The EDV-TEK project is located in the technology research field and focuses on four sub-dimensions of this research field: identification, emergence, diffusion and exploitation. These dimensions are investigated on the basis of the application field of climate change mitigation technologies (TEK). Natural language processing (NLP) methods will be applied, mainly in the form of Deep Learning, for example neural networks and LLMs (Large Language Models).
In the first project phase, the focus was on the identification of TEKs. In particular, the focus was on the selection of suitable Deep Learning models for the classification of TEKs in the patent dataset. For this purpose, a literature review on the different architectures of neural networks and LLMs was conducted. The algorithms have been trained and validated for performance using the freely available and widely used United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent dataset for classifying patents involving climate change mitigation technologies.
